Learning Activities & Resources

I learnt that not every pipeline is going to work so you have to go find another one that could work. I did the prac with the sass and in my mind it’s pretty much css to me but different.

Setting up a pipeline shouldn’t be so difficult with so many steps providing many opportunities for things to go wrong.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights

I do hope that organisations who use a pipeline of sorts don’t make their new employees attempt to do a pipeline with minimal guidance because finding one that wouldn’t mess with me was a pain already. As far as employability goes I’m happy with just uploading stuff to github and making peace with it without the need for a pipeline, but having a pipeline is just adding extra steps. I can see that it would be necessary in some forms of work, but I’m just going to have to avoid those kinds of jobs because I do not have the patience to follow a tutorial for hours just to get errors and broken pipelines.
