## Learning Experiment 

### Hypothesis:

I hypothesise that adjusting my sleep schedule to include a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, coupled with implementing relaxation techniques before bed, will lead to improved sleep quality and overall well-being compared to my previous week's sleep routine.

### Test:

To test this hypothesis, I will adhere to a consistent sleep schedule, going to bed at 9 pm and waking up at 6:30 am every day for the entire week. I will track my sleep quality using a notepad app on my phone and assess my subjective experience upon waking up each morning.

### Results:

Throughout the week, I followed my adjusted sleep schedule and used supplements before sleeping. Here are the key observations and results:

1. Sleep Quality: Adhering to a consistent sleep schedule and using supplements significantly improved my sleep quality compared to the previous week. I experienced fewer interruptions during the night and woke up feeling more refreshed and rested each morning.

2. Mood and Well-being: Using supplements before bed positively impacted my mood and overall well-being. I noticed a reduction in stress levels and an improvement in my ability to unwind and relax before sleep. This translated into a more positive outlook and increased energy levels throughout the day.

3. Productivity and Focus: The improved sleep quality had a noticeable impact on my productivity and focus during the day. With a better-rested mind and body, I found myself more alert and able to concentrate on tasks with greater clarity and efficiency.

### Learning Insights:

Reflecting on this sleep experiment, I have gained valuable insights into the importance of maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and incorporating supplements to promote better sleep quality and overall well-being. By prioritising sleep and adopting healthy sleep habits, I have experienced improvements in my mood, productivity, and focus. Moving forward, I plan to continue practising these sleep hygiene habits to support my overall health and optimise my daily performance. Eventually, I hope you have a full night's rest without the need for supplements to help me sleep.
