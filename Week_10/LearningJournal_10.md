## Content Insight:

I realise that there is a reason for having security measures that seem like common sense, because there are people out there among us who don’t have common sense. I couldn’t believe it when they had a whole 
video dedicated to having a strong password. Why Password1 instead of 1passworD? Come on guys.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights:

Understanding the significance of regular backups, strong passwords, and user role management has highlighted the foundational elements of site security giving me and anyone a pretty good reason to take it 
seriously. Additionally, learning about authentication keys and proper file permissions has provided a deeper understanding of securing user sessions and data integrity. When it comes to Security and privacy 
I will be sure to choose a good host who has my best interests at heart.
