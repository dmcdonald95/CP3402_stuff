Learning Activities & Resources
This week I went through the practical of creating a child theme that has 6 visual changes to it. With my main objective being to create a child theme I decided to spend less time watching videos on linkedin and just dive into the task. However it did introduce me to the concept of child themes so I at least know they exist now.
Estimated Hours
About 3 hours this week
Content Insights
Much like a family in the 90s the parent will always rule over the child, this can be compared to parent and child themes.
Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I may want to steer clear of a career in web development as much of the content I have had an encounter with so far hasn’t really ignited my passion or given me pleasure when completing tasks. I’m just doing things because they need to be done. When it comes to employability I’d say being paid for doing the work makes a huge difference as money is a very good motivator in my opinion. That being said, I’m sure employers would want to hire someone who has a passion in the field of web development if they wanted to hire a web developer. I however will most likely be applying for something that isn’t web development so if there is something I have learnt this week it's that I should sit down and think about my life to be sure I don’t enter a career that does not fulfil me.
