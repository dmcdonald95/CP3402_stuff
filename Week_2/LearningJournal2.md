Learning Activities & Resources

I spent most of this week on the practical activity working with Joomla. I was hoping some of the videos on the linkedIn would assist with Joomla, but it seemed to be focussed on Wordpress. I wasn’t too sure at first if I had installed Joomla correctly because all the demos and tutorials I saw showed something different to what I had on screen.

Content Insights
Can’t really say I had some insightful or meaningful insights this week. Joomla being the real CMS I have dealt with I was expecting there to be some sort of coding involved, instead what I got was something that wasn’t really wix, but kind of felt like it. This was due to me being able to add images and articles of text to the various pages without the need to write some code to format the images and text how I wanted.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After going through some of the videos on LinkedIn I feel as though Wordpress is similar to Joomla, but that’s to be expected seeing as they’re both CMSs. I would hope that in the future I am given some sort of guidance when working on a project on a system I am unfamiliar with, because the hardest part for me was the beginning and getting started. Great news though, I should have a good start with Wordpress due to Mr Morten suggesting a whole video series on setting up Wordpress.
