Learning Activities & Resources

Looked at the prac and got a little confused because it looked like it was already done, but I decided to squeeze in some things like an echo, decision, repetition, function, and included the includes. I really only viewed the videos that seemed to be helpful otherwise, just doing the work actually gets things done.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights

Php seems like a big deal in the industry and I’m sure if I wanted to get into web development I would make use of php a lot. As far as employability is concerned I think some of the little bits of coding involved with the functions used on websites would be useful in other areas that aren’t web development. I guess with php it can help provide a different point of view on coding.
