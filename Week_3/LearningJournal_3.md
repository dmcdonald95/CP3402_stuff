Learning Activities & Resources
Went through the videos on linkedin that pretty much got me started on the prac. After that I went into surgery and completely forgot all about the prac and learning journal, but working with Wordpress was a lot more pleasant than Joomla.
Estimated Hours
About 4 hours this week
Content Insights
Comparing Joomla to Wordpress, I very much prefer Wordpress as it seems to be widely supported by developers who upload tutorials and helpful content on how to make Wordpress work. 
Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Thinking future career wise I would hope that the company/business I am employed by would be using resources that are strongly supported with many different resources available to help users learn about the program being used. After learning the basics of Wordpress, tasks become a lot easier and are completed faster than last time.
