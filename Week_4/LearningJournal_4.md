## Learning Activities & Resources

Using a previously made child theme I placed a background image on the website. Managed to get xampp working with the apache and mysql to store data such as 
user information for logging in. Hopefully the screen shots can tell that story.

I guess the whole topic of version control would be the insight. I’ve only ever used it for programming and I didn’t think it would be needed in web development 
in the same way it would be used for coding. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

When it comes to development of a website, having the version control would help you to update or make changes to your website without looking like an ass in 
front of everyone. I would think that if I were to get into web development it would be crucial to understand version control as I would not be the only one 
working on a website. I have had times when working on a project with others there would be an issue of someone pushing their commits without pulling first which 
resulted in my work all being undone.
