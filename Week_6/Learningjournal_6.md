Content Insights
Nothing really insightful from the videos this week other than I feel it relates to design thinking 3 where we had meetings daily and tried to have as many meetings as possible. Going to the topic of stand up meetings, I have had no experience with them seeing as I’m usually sitting down during meetings. Ever wonder why we sit in meetings and when we stand up for a brief moment it feels weird like we don’t fit in and we aren’t doing things right. So I guess if we explicitly state that we are going to stand up for this meeting, it shouldn’t feel as weird.
Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After creating a linkedin account and connecting with my team I have been wondering if people actually hire through linkedin. So far I’ve seen jobs being advertised and people posting stuff about something related to their field like Facebook, but for career people. I have seen someone comment under a random post by some company saying, “Hire me please, I need a job.” and I have a feeling that guy didn’t get hired.
